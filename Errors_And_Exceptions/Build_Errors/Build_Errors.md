# Build Errors in Flutter

## 1. Error: "Android license status unknown"

### Cause

This error occurs when Flutter cannot find the necessary Android SDK licenses.

### Solution

Run the following command to accept the licenses:

```sh
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

Follow the prompts to accept all licenses.

## 2. Error: "Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugKotlin'"

### Cause

This happens when there is a mismatch in the Kotlin version.

### Solution

Update the Kotlin version in your `android/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10' // Ensure this is the latest stable version
```

Then, run:

```sh
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

## 3. Error: "FAILURE: Build failed with an exception."

### Cause

This generic error can be due to outdated dependencies, Gradle issues, or missing configurations.

### Solution

Try the following steps:

1. Run:

   ```sh
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. If the issue persists, update dependencies:

   ```sh
   flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
   ```

3. Ensure your Gradle version is up to date in `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:

   ```properties
   distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.5-all.zip
   ```

---

## 4. Error: "A problem occurred evaluating project ':app'"

### Cause

This error occurs due to incorrect Gradle configurations or dependency issues.

### Solution

1. Check for syntax errors in `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure you have the correct `google-services.json` (for Firebase projects).
3. Run:

   ```sh
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

## 5. Error: "The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 8.0"

### Cause

Flutter requires a minimum iOS deployment target that may be higher than 8.0.

### Solution

Update your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

Then run:

```sh
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Conclusion

These are some of the most common Flutter build errors and their solutions. If issues persist, try running `flutter doctor` to check for any missing dependencies.
